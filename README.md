# DiscordBot
Python Based Discord Bot created by the GMU CS community

## Structure
* 'DISCORD_TOKEN' grabbed from a ```.env``` file in the same directory - ```.env``` file is omitted here.
* All files in root can and should be ignored, important functions to be added are in ```cogs/```.
* ```import uwuifier``` in ```cogs/course.py``` is a novelty and can be removed on request.

## TODO:
* git gud
